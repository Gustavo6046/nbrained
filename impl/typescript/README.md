TypeScript implementation. This is but a prototype. The production
implementation is in Rust, and two alternative implementations for
ZDoom are planned (BCS and ZScript).

In the meantime, once produced, a first version of this code will
serve as the starting point and blank slate for community input;
atop it, general feedback, ideas and suggestions, in the form of
GitHub issues, will culminate in the release of a second TypeScript
prototype, with refinements and several different kinds of polish.
Maybe totally inanimate gargoyle statues too. _(Bring your own
bundles o'dynamite, though, just in case!)_
