- [**Up:** _API Documentation Index_](../index.md)

API documentation for the TypeScript prototype, the first lines
of wit and overdetermination spotted regarding nbrained. If you
are equally brave (and equally reckless), go ahead! The
craziest ideas are the most successful ones... when they are 
successful, that is!

refer to that to navigate through the API documentations!
_Warning: there will be no top link back to the top-level
