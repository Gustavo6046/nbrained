# E3M2: API Documentation (for the TypeScript Edition)

- **[Return to Top](../../index.md)**
- [**Up:** _API Documentation Index_](../index.md)

API documentation for the TypeScript prototype, the first lines
of wit and overdetermination spotted regarding nbrained. If you
are equally brave (and equally reckless), go ahead! The
craziest ideas are the most successful ones... when they are 
successful, that is!

## Navigation

This is but a work in progress at the moment.

To be fair, though, how many API docs do you want from a
prototype implementation that isn't even finished itself? Might
as well write an entire encyclopaedia on every single token
the lexer spews at your face!
