# E2M1: Technical Documentation

**[Return to Top](../index.md)**

This supersection of documentation is concerned with the most practical,
yet general, aspects of the theory behind nbrained. If you like arrays,
you like this! Otherwise, perhaps it is better if you stick to just using
some implementation's more high-level interface, or maybe just don't use
nbrained as a library at all - let the big boys do it instead!

## Table of Contents

This section is a work in progress. There are a few technical details in the
root README, though.
